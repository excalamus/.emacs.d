#+TITLE: init.el -- Principium de Excalamus

Maintain package consistency across multiple devices using [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]]
with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package.el]].  It works by pointing [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] to personal
forks.  The forks help with submitting pull requests and provides
another point of consistency (i.e. all devices sync to personal repo).
